Share results of analyzing mediation effects at the gene-level for sequencing data.

Notations: 

X: independent variable  
Y: response variable  
M: mediating or intervening variable  


## Effect of X on Y after accounting for M

1. I first apply a "regressing out" approach and derive mean and covariate estimates for the effect size of the differences between the effect of X on Y and the effect of X on Y after regressing M out of Y. [Download PDF](docs/covariateTest.pdf)

2. I consider the problem in the context of classic single-mediator analysis and compare the results between this and the "regressing out" approach. 
    * Both approaches were applied to an [experimental dataset](sobeltest.html), and the results of [top genes are compared and discussed](illustrate-cases.html).
    * I learned that in single-mediator analysis, when generalized least square is used, the product of alpha and beta does not equal to tau.prime.
    
3. I did some simuation studies to aid my understanding of the problem.
    * I consider scenarios under [condition differences in Y and M](sobel-simulatino.html). This turns out not an intuitive way of looking at the problem.
    * I simulate cases of signficant DE genes (effect of X on Y) with [varying levels of correlation between X and M](simulate-cases.html).
